      <h3>My Hero Academia</h3>
      <p>
        <p>The home page of the website includes the summary of the whole story and the setting or background of the story. 
        People who visit the site will at first have a good understanding of how the story of My Hero Academia goes. 
        If they are interested in knowing more about the story, there are links to two other pages where people can learn 
        about the main sections of the plot and different main characters that are essential to the development of the story.
        There is also some other additional information and details that people should know about the show in order to 
        better understand the story and appreciate the efforts that the author has put into it. </p>

        Setting:
        <p>Nearly 80% of the population of the world are born with some kind of ability called 'quirk', and 
        usually people can have only one quirk since their bodies cannot handle more. 
        Since the appearance of quirks, people use their quirks to do wrongs and hurt other people. People call them 'villains'. 
        Quirks are not transferrable. Therefore, people without quirks can hardly protect themselves under the attack of villains. 
        On the other hand, the occupation, 'hero', has been created as people with quirks decided to use their powers to protect others.</p>

        Summary:
        <p>A young man, Midoriya Izuku, is born without quirk. He admires heroes and wants to protect others. 
        He would rather put himself in danger than seeing others getting hurt because he wants to protect the smiles of others.
        His favorite hero is All Might, the No.1 hero at the time, and he loves that All Might always saves people with a smile on his face.
        But since he has no quirks, others have often counseled him to be a police rather than a hero. Not wanting to give up, 
        the young man one day encountered All Might, who later transferred his quirk to Midoriya. </p>

        <p>Since quirks are not transferrable, All Might told Midoriya that the quirk, named 'One For All', is a combination of two quirks -
        a quirk that can transfer quirks from one person to another (which is useless by itself if the user has only one quirk), 
        and a quirk that can store power and energy. Thanks to the first quirk in One For All, the quirk is transferrable, and since 
        Midoriya had no quirk born with him, he is a good candidate for One For All.</p>

        <p>From that time on, Midoriya learned how to master the quirk and learned of the background and history of the quirk. 
        He trained and learned from his favorite hero All Might, and got accepted by a hero training school - U.A. There he met his classmates 
        who are all wanting to become a Pro hero for different reasons. In school they have training programs to train them to be a Pro hero. 
        They also need to complete their internships to gain real world experience. But from time to time, villains will come and threaten to 
        destory the school and its students. One of the main villains, Shigaraki Tomura, hated All Might, and swore that he would kill All Might 
        some day. </p>
        
        <p>This is a story of how students of U.A. grow and learn and defeat villains.
        This is a story of how All Might and Midoriya fight against evil.
        This is a story of how Midoriya becomes the greatest hero and the symbol of peace.</p>
