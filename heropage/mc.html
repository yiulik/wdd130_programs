                <h2 class="char1">Midoriya Izuku</h2>
                <img class="char-img" src="images\midoriya.jpg" alt="Midoriya Izuku">
                <p class="charpara">
                    Midoriya is the protagonist of the story. <br>
                    He is kind and polite and always loves to help others around him. <br>
                    He always likes to analyze heroes and their abilities. <br>
                    When he was young, he even dreamed to be one of the Pro heroes 
                    so that he could work with heroes that he admires. <br>
                    The person that inspired him to be a hero is the No.1 Hero at the time, All Might. <br>
                    Midoriya wants to be a hero who can save people and bring hope to the world. <br>
                    However, he is born without quirks, meaning he has no superpowers. <br>
                    People without quirks cannot be a hero because being a hero is dangerous 
                    in that they need to defeat villains and take the risk of losing their lives. <br>
                    He is a childhood friend with Bakugou.
                </p>
                <h2 class="char2">Bakugou Katsuki</h2>
                <img class="char-img" src="images\bakugou_resized.jpg" alt="Bakugou Katsuki">
                <p class="charpara">
                    Bakugou is Midoriya's classmate, and he also grows up with Midoriya. <br>
                    Even though they grew up together, unlike Midoriya, <br>Bakugou is easily-provoked and very arrogant and egocentric.
                    He does not really care what others think of him.<br>
                    Bakugou wants to be a hero because of All Might. <br>He loves the fact that All Might always wins in a fight, and so he is very obsessed with winning his opponents.
                    Bakugou has a really strong quirk which boosts his ego furthermore, and because of his quirk, he looked down on Midoriya, who is quirkless at the time.                    
                </p>
                <h2 class="char3">Todoroki Shoto</h2>
                <img class="char-img" src="images\todoroki_resized2.jpg" alt="Todoroki Shoto">
                <p class="charpara">
                    Todoroki is one of the cool kids at school because he is always calm and logical.<br>
                    He is a classmate with Midoriya and Bakugou.<br>
                    He admires All Might and wants to become a hero because of him.<br>
                    However, he is a son of the No.2 Hero, who hated All Might and always wants Todoroki to surpass All Might one day.<br>
                    Todoroki hates his father for his violence towards his other family members and how he treated Todoroki so badly when he was still a young boy.<br>
                    Todoroki wants to become like All Might - a great hero who helps and brings smiles back to people.

                <h2 class="char4">All Might</h2>
                <img class="char-img" src="images\allmight_resized2.png" alt="All Might">
                <p class="charpara">
                    All Might is a hero name, his real name is Toshinori Yagi. <br>But since he is the No.1 Hero at the time, everyone calls him All Might.
                    All Might always has a smile on his face. <br>He wants people to know that when he is here, there will be peace. Thus he is also called the symbol of peace.<br>
                    He is passionate and nice to others, keeping in mind that bringing smiles adn hope to others is what a great hero would do.<br>
                    He is also the mentor of Midoriya later in the story.

                <h2 class="char5">Shigaraki Tomura</h2>
                <img class="char-img" src="images\shigaraki_resized2.jpg" alt="Shigaraki Tomura">
                <p class="charpara">
                    Shigaraki is born with a quirk that will eliminate everything that he touches with 5 fingers simultaneously.<br>
                    His family members are scared of him because of his quirk and would not be close to him. Therefore he grew up very lonely.<br>
                    Later on, He is adopted by All For One and becomes a villain. <br>
                    He swears that one day he would kill All Might.<br>
                    He hates everything and wants to destroy everything with his hands. <br>
                </p>
                <h2 class="char6">All For One</h2>
                <img class="char-img" src="images\allforone2_resized2.jpg" alt="All For One">
                <p class="charpara">
                    If All Might is the symbol of peace, then All For One is the symbol of fear. <br>
                    All For One is mysterious and evil. He treats everyone as tools.<br>
                    The real name of All For One is unknown. <br>He is called All For One by others because he has a quirk that can steal quirks from others, therefore he has many quirks.
                    He wants to kill All Might and Midoriya because they are the only ones who are strong enough to stop him. <br>
                    He also want to steal All Might's quirk because it is the most powerful quirk in the world.<br>
