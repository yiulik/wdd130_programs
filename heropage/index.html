                <p class="intro"><strong>My Hero Academia is one of the most motivating Shounen (i.e. youth) anime recently. 
                    <br>Its story develops around the main character, Midoriya Izuku, and his classmates.
                </strong></p>
                <h2 class="abouth"><strong>About My Hero Academia:</strong></h2>
                <p class="aboutp">Even though the theme of the show is superheroes, it does not only illustrate how powerful the superheroes are 
                    and how bad guys are defeated, but it also guides its audience to explore the different qualities and aspects of being a true hero, even the dark side of it. 
                    It strikes a good balance between reality and fantasy and motivates its audience to become better every day.
                </p>
                <h2 class="settingh"><strong>Setting of the story:</strong></h2>
                <p class="settingp">Nearly 80% of the population of the world are born with some kind of ability called 'quirk', 
                    and usually people can have only one quirk since their bodies cannot handle more. 
                    Since the appearance of quirks, people use their quirks to do wrongs and hurt other people. People call them 'villains'. 
                    Quirks are not transferrable. Therefore, people without quirks can hardly protect themselves under the attack of villains. 
                    On the other hand, the occupation, 'hero', has been created as people with quirks decided to use their powers to protect others.
                </p>
                <h2 class="sumh"><strong>Summary:</strong></h2>
                <p class="sump">A young man, Midoriya Izuku, is born without quirk. He admires heroes and wants to protect others. 
                    He would rather put himself in danger than see others getting hurt because he wants to protect the smiles of others. 
                    His favorite hero is All Might, the No.1 hero at the time, and he loves that All Might always saves people with a smile on his face. 
                    But since he has no quirks, others have often counseled him to be a police rather than a hero.
