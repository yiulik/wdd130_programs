        <h2>My Name is William Lee</h2>
        <h3>A Little About Me</h3>
        <p>
            I am from Hong Kong, and so William is actually not my real first name.
            My real first name is Chin Yiu. "Chin" is written like "展" and "Yiu" is written like "耀" in Chinese.
            I am currently studying for a Mechanical Engineering major, but I am thinking to change it to Computer Science,
            that is why I am studying this course. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Honestly, I am not sure if I really want to pursue a Computer Science related career path because I don't really know what I want to do with my life.
            I am just waiting to see if someday I would be able to figure out what I really want.
        </p>
        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>
            I have a lot of interests. But I feel like most of them are not really "real interests" because I give up on those interests easily.
            For example, I really like to learn different things, but at the same time I would easily give up learning something if it takes me a lot of time to understand. 
            The one thing that I would consider one of my "real interests" is watching Japanese animation, they are usually called "anime".
            The reason why I like watching anime is that I have learned a lot of different perspectives on one matter just by watching all those characters doing their things. It is really amazing. But it is hard to explain in just a few sentences, so I would stop here.
        </p>
        <h3>Religious Life</h3>
        <p>
            I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints for my whole life, which is 23 years. I think one of my favorite quotes from the leaders of the church is
            <i>"Never let a problem to be solved become more important than a person to be loved."</i> by President Thomas S. Monson
            I really like it becasue I have seen a lot of people who are obsessed with their own power and thought that others are "weaker" than them because they lack the ability to become high-achievers.
            And those who are prideful would despise others rather than giving them encouragement and support.
